key Features:-

1. Modular Design with Functions:- add(), subtract(), multiply(), and divide().

2. Dynamic User Input:- The program takes input from the user for both the operation selection and the numbers to be operated on. 

3. User-Friendly Interface:- Users are prompted to select an arithmetic operation from a menu by entering a corresponding number.

4. Error Handling in Division:- A key feature is the inclusion of error handling for division operations. The divide() function checks if the second number (y) is zero before performing the division.

5. Real-time Calculation and Output:- The program performs the selected operation in real-time, immediately displaying the result to the user. This feature ensures that the user receives instant feedback on their inputs.
